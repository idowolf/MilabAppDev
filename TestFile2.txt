[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Narrator:]
How the rumors are spreading like vines
Of a man who has been glorified
News finds its way
To the empire one day
Where the envious ruler resides

[Nafaryus:]
Should I fall for the stories I hear?
Is he really a threat I should fear?
Such a foolish young man
Doesn't seem to understand
So let me be perfectly clear

He may have them inspired
Eating out of his hand
But he'll never be ruler of this land

For myself I must see
What the hype is about
I admit I'm intrigued

I've heard the whispering of revolution
I know the aim of your plan
You think insurgency is your solution
And put your faith in one man

[Narrator:]
His decision is made
So his journey begins
Off to the edge of The Realm
To meet the savior

In the coming days
They'll announce his grace
And he'll ask to be amazed

As a symbol of power and might
It will make for a breathtaking sight
In a massive display
With his family and guards by his side

[Nafaryus:]
Arabelle who means the world to me
Our loyal son, my heir, your future king
And Faythe I treasure more than all the diamonds in my crown
It isn't hard to see
I couldn't be more proud

Into the far off reaches of the land
To witness this great spectacle first hand
Is Gabriel the God he claims to be?
I guess we'll see
Yes we shall see
